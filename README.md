AI-related job postings increased globally, but decreased in Asia.  
However, Asia still remain the region with the largest AI job offer share.

The net global effect of AI continues to reduce overall employment.  
Job creation driven by AI does not yet offset jobs lost to automation.

> The challenge for the next decade will be requalification.  
> Nations and companies that invest in upskilling will capture AI’s economic benefits while minimizing social disruption.
